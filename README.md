## About
This program is designed to facilitate the diagnosis of brain tumors from 2D MRI scan images, for both accuracy and timeliness. The model is created using TensorFlow API in Python, and it uses high-level Keras. The image classifier is based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network . For more information, try the [Streamlit app](https://share.streamlit.io/oct4pie/brain-tumor-detection/main/app.py).
